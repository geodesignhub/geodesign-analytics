# Geodesign Analytics

Geodesign Analytics is a visualization tool designed to deconstruct and analyze geodesign projects. It leverages the [Geodesignhub API](https://www.geodesignhub.com/api/) to download design information and provides insights into the performance of participants in a workshop. This tool helps you understand the social dynamics of a change team, identify effective negotiators, and improve your geodesign projects.
